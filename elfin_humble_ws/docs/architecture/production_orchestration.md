# Production Orchestration

This document defines the production loading-cell orchestration contract. The
same state machine and exploration contracts apply in simulation and on
hardware. Adapters may differ by backend; authorization, state progression, and
online map inputs may not.

## Startup Boundary

`WAIT_START` is the initial state. Launch completion, lifecycle activation,
service readiness, sensor readiness, timers, and ordinary `run` / `step`
commands must not authorize robot motion, vacuum changes, or detection.

The only initial authorization event is an explicit operator `start` command.
After it is accepted, the orchestrator resets the cargo map and performs the
initial container exploration before prompting for a placed box.

## Operator Request Correlation

The orchestrator publishes each operator prompt with a generated request ID,
prompt kind, current state, and display text. Prompt messages must not contain
box geometry, pose, identity, dimensions, or simulation truth.

An operator pickup-ready event authorizes one cycle only when it carries the
exact current request ID and the expected schema version. Missing, blank,
stale, duplicate, malformed, or wrong-ID confirmations must not emit motion or
detection effects.

## Pure State Contract

The state reducer is a ROS-free contract. It may consume plain decoded events
and return declarative effects, but it must not call ROS, sleep, read YAML,
lookup TF, inspect Gazebo, or execute motion.

Effects describe work for a node layer, for example `CALL_ACTION`,
`CALL_SERVICE`, `PUBLISH_PROMPT`, and `PUBLISH_STATUS`. Effects that may move
the robot, change vacuum, or trigger detection must mark that capability
explicitly so tests can assert startup and request-correlation safety.

## Required Cycle

The required nominal progression is:

```text
WAIT_START
  -> RESET_CARGO_MAP
  -> EXPLORE_CONTAINER
  -> RETURN_PICK_OBSERVE
  -> WAIT_PICKUP_READY
  -> DETECT
  -> COMPUTE_PLACEMENT
  -> PLAN_PICK
  -> EXEC_PICK
  -> PLAN_PLACE
  -> EXEC_PLACE
  -> COMMIT_AND_VERIFY
  -> RETURN_PICK_OBSERVE
  -> WAIT_PICKUP_READY
```

Every return to `WAIT_PICKUP_READY` must happen after reaching
`pick_observe_pose`. The cargo map persists across placed boxes and is updated
only from live depth integration and explicit placement commits.

## Failure Boundaries

Failure handling must distinguish pre-pick, carrying, release, verification,
abort, and recovery boundaries.

Before payload attachment, failures return to a non-moving wait or explicit
retry/recovery boundary. While carrying, failures transition to a carry fault
and preserve vacuum until an explicit recovery confirms payload release.
Placement commits are idempotent and must not double-count attempts.

## Exploration Boundary

Exploration policy contracts are immutable, serializable, ROS-free plain data.
Policies may propose or score candidate views, but they must not execute
motion, mutate the map, read TF, or receive ground truth.

Exploration integration must correlate the settled view request ID, source
acquisition stamp, expected map revision, and container geometry hash. Stale,
ambiguous, repeated, or mismatched view integration fails closed.

Simulation evaluation may read Gazebo truth only offline or in test/eval scope.
The online production path must not branch on `sim_mode`, consume GT, or use a
fake production success path.
