"""Hold elfin_joint6 (EOF roll) during pick.

The suction cup is coaxial with J6. Rotating that joint spins the panel
about the contact normal and does not help seal. Pick waypoints used to
bake detection PCA yaw into the tool quaternion, which commanded that
roll. The executor pins J6 on the executed joint path instead: J4/J5 may
still fold the wrist to tool-down from observe.
